## Introduction

MMYOLO is an open source toolbox for YOLO series algorithms based on PyTorch and [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection). It is a part of the [OpenMMLab](https://openmmlab.com/) project.

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.6+**.

<summary>Major features</summary>

- **Unified and convenient benchmark**

  MMYOLO unifies the implementation of modules in various YOLO algorithms and provides a unified benchmark. Users can compare and analyze in a fair and convenient way.

- **Rich and detailed documentation**

  MMYOLO provides rich documentation for getting started, model deployment, advanced usages, and algorithm analysis, making it easy for users at different levels to get started and make extensions quickly.

- **Modular Design**

  MMYOLO decomposes the framework into different components where users can easily customize a model by combining different modules with various training and testing strategies.

## What's New

**v0.1.0** was released on 21/9/2022:

- Unified component interfaces based on [OpenMMLab 2.0](https://github.com/open-mmlab) and [MMDetection 3.0](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/3.x)
- Support YOLOv5/YOLOX training, support YOLOv6 inference. Deployment will be supported soon.
- Refactored YOLOX from MMDetection to accelerate training and inference.
- Detailed introduction and advanced tutorials are provided, see the [English tutorial](https://mmyolo.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

For release history and update details, please refer to [changelog](https://mmyolo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/changelog.html).

## Installation

MMYOLO relies on PyTorch, MMCV, MMEngine, and MMDetection. Below are quick steps for installation. Please refer to the [Install Guide](docs/en/get_started.md) for more detailed instructions.

```shell
conda create -n open-mmlab python=3.8 pytorch==1.10.1 torchvision==0.11.2 cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch -y
conda activate open-mmlab
pip install openmim
mim install mmengine
mim install "mmcv>=2.0.0rc1"
mim install "mmdet>=3.0.0rc0"
# for albumentations
pip install -r requirements/albu.txt
git clone https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmyolo.git
cd mmyolo
mim install -e .
```

## Tutorial

MMYOLO is based on MMDetection and adopts the same code structure and design approach. To get better use of this, please read [MMDetection Overview](https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started.html) for the first understanding of MMDetection.

The usage of MMYOLO is almost identical to MMDetection and all tutorials are straightforward to use, you can also learn about [MMDetection User Guide and Advanced Guide](https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/en/3.x/).

For different parts from MMDetection, we have also prepared user guides and advanced guides, please read our [documentation](https://mmyolo.readthedocs.io/zenh_CN/latest/).
