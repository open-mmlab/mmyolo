    described in the paper "YOLO-Pose: Enhancing YOLO for Multi Person Pose
    Estimation Using Object Keypoint Similarity Loss" by Debapriya et al.

    (2022).
    The OKS loss is used for keypoint-based object recognition and consists
    of a measure of the similarity between predicted and ground truth
    keypoint locations, adjusted by the size of the object in the image.
    The loss function takes as input the predicted keypoint locations, the
    ground truth keypoint locations, a mask indicating which keypoints are
    valid, and bounding boxes for the objects.
