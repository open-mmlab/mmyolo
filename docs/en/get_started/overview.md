MMYOLO runs on Linux, Windows, macOS, and supports PyTorch 1.7 or later. It has the following three characteristics:

- üïπÔ∏è **Unified and convenient algorithm evaluation**

  MMYOLO unifies various YOLO algorithm modules and provides a unified evaluation process, so that users can compare and analyze fairly and conveniently.

- üìö **Extensive documentation for started and advanced**

  MMYOLO provides a series of documents, including getting started, deployment, advanced practice and algorithm analysis, which is convenient for different users to get started and expand.

- üß© **Modular Design**

  MMYOLO disentangled the framework into modular components, and users can easily build custom models by combining different modules and training and testing strategies.
