# EasyDeploy Deployment

This project acts as a separate deployment project of MMYOLO, with the intention of divorcing the system of MMDeploy, and supporting the conversion and deployment functions of users once they finish the training of models, so as to reduce the learning and engineering costs of users.

Currently, it supports the conversion of ONNX format and TensorRT format, and will support other inference platforms in the future.

You can find more details about MMYOLO EasyDeploy in the [easydeploy document](../../../../projects/easydeploy/README.md).
